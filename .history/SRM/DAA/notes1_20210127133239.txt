Basic :
Problem -> Flowchart/Algorithm/ pseudocode -> Program -> solution

Algorithm :
    A collection of unambiguous instructions 
    a specific sequence
    input
    output
    with finite time

Characteristics of Algorithms :

    ->  input
    ->  output
    ->  Definiteness
    ->  Uniqueness
    ->  Correctness
    ->  Effectiveness
    ->  Finiteness
    ->  Simplicity
    ->  Generality

 Fundamental Stages Of Problem Solving
    Understanding the Problem
    Planning the Algorithm -> Data Structure managing
    Design the Algorithm  -> Based on the Time and spaces complexity
    Validating The Algorithm -> Is output is correct or not
    Analysing the Algorithm
    Implementation and Empirical Analysis
    Post analysis
