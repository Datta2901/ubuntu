Heap in C++ STL | make_heap(), push_heap(), pop_heap(), sort_heap(), is_heap, is_heap_until()
Heap data structure can be implemented in a range using STL which allows faster input into heap and retrieval of a number always results in the largest number i.e. largest number of the remaining numbers is popped out each time. Other numbers of the heap are arranged depending upon the implementation.

Operations on heap :

1. make_heap() :- This function is used to convert a range in a container to a heap.

2. front() :- This function displays the first element of heap which is the maximum number.
