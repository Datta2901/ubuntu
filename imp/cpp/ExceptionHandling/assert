use #include<cassert> likbrary

syntax : assert(one logical condition)

process : as follows
       //  your code{
      //       ...
     //       }
    //if the logical condition is true then only the program continues
   //otherwuse a error symbol will be displayed by the compiler at the 
  // run time..

   ~~if u want to disable the assert then use
   below macro

    #define NDEBUG //imp

    eg: if your answer is correct locally for some test conditions 
    you want to submit the problem then the above macro is useful
