The following applies to examples in the segments of the video lectures from C++ For C Programmers Part B 2.10(The Inheritance Mechanism), 2.11(A Derived Class) and 2.12 (Students and Graduate Students).

The student â€“ graduate_student code as given in the text and lectures(if not yet modified) is outdated. It was initially meant to capture the easily understood ISA relationship between a base class (student) and a publically derived class(graduate_student).

The code uses char* to express certain data. This was in use in C and early versions of C++. So it is natural for a C programmer to grasp it.  This functionality remains when using routines found in <cstring>. Modern C++ has moved on to the use of <string> as a basic type. 

We will give code files for the code as originally displayed in early versions of the course and text and rewrite using string.
 
The string is a container for type character. Its interface is similar to other sequential container types.
It allows the use of iterators. Here is a small sample of its functionality. 


 
size
Return length of string (public member function )
clear
Clear string (public member function )
empty
Test if string is empty (public member function )

Element access:


operator[]
Get character of string (public member function )
at
Get character in string (public member function )
back 
Access last character (public member function )
front 
Access first character (public member function )

Modifiers:


operator+=
Append to string (public member function )
append
Append to string (public member function )
swap
Swap string values (public member function )
pop_back 
Delete last character (public member function )

String operations:


c_str
Get C string equivalent (public member function )
find
Find content in string (public member function )
compare
Compare strings (public member function )



operator+
Concatenate strings (function )
operator>>
Extract string from stream (function )
operator<<
Insert string into stream (function )
getline
Get line from stream into string (function )
